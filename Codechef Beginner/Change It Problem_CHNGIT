for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    n = int(input())
    li = list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
    s = list(set(li))
    maxcount = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if li.count(s[i]) > maxcount:
            maxcount =  li.count(s[i])
                    
                    
            
    print(len(li)-maxcount)
