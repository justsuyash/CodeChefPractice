Note : for two numbers considering all things equal, the math.gcd is about 0.17(about slightly less) seconds faster than the self build gcd, that means for more than 2 number for everynumber the taking the gcd will add 0.17 seconds to the loop. We can even do the third solution to make it the fastest:



# cook your dish here
from math import gcd

for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    m,b = map(int,input().split(' '))
    
    print(gcd(m,b)*2)
    
2nd Solution :

# cook your dish here
def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    else:
        return gcd(b%a,a)

for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    m,b = map(int,input().split(' '))
    
    print(gcd(m,b)*2)
    
    
3rd Soulution :

from sys import stdin 
from math import gcd
for _ in range(int(stdin.readline())):
	print(2*gcd(*map(int,stdin.readline().split())))
