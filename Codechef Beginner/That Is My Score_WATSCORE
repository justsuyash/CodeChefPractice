Note : There is one complicated way to do it and there is an easier way to do it, this way is not that complicated actually, its merely to state a different way to solve a problem. You dont necessarily need to implement it in this way but just know the intuition of this might help you become a prolific thinker. Another menthod is also done below this code. Both Methods take 0.2 seconds unsurprisingly.


# cook your dish here
for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    n = int(input())
         
    li1 = []
    li2 = []
        
    for i in range(n):

        x,y = map(int,input().split(' '))
        
        if x in li1 and y >= li2[li1.index(x)]:
            li1[li1.index(x)] = x
            li2[li1.index(x)] = y
        elif x in li1 and y < li2[li1.index(x)]:
            continue
        else:
            li1.append(x)
            li2.append(y)
    
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(li1)):
        if li1[i] <= 8:
            total = total+li2[i]
            
            
    print(total)
    
    
    
## Second Way :


# cook your dish here
for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    n = int(input())
    
    li = [0]*12
    
    for i in range(n):

        x,y = map(int,input().split(' '))
        
        if li[x] < y:
            li[x] = y
    
    total = sum(li[1:9])
            
    print(total)
