Note : the first solution gives TLE, there is a tip to be noted here, strings take a lot longer to compare than int, so keep doing it.

# cook your dish here
n = int(input())

li = list(map(int,input().split()))
    
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if (li.count(i)==0):
        print(i,end=' ')
        
        
#This solution takes 0.06 seconds

# cook your dish here
n = int(input())
    
li = list(map(int,input().split()))

count = [1]*(n+1)

for i in li:
    count[i] = 0
    
print(*(i for i in range(1,n+1) if count[i]))


so whats the difference: the difference is we the number of criminals is always going to be less than totaal number of gang members hence this printing takes less time.
