This is a really good question: By this time you already know that sting takes less time for everything than ints, sos below is method to do it with int. But we will give you a second solution as we dont really need the integer value of lists we are essentially just counting them



# cook your dish here
for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    li1 = []
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(10):
        li = list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
        li1.extend(li)
    
    
    for i in li1:
        if i <= 30:
            count  += 1
        
        
    if count >= 60:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
