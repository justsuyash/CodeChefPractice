Note : We must realize that "second_maximum_number%maximum_number" is the maximum modulo we can get, Hence the goal is to find the largest and the second largest number. This is the easiest way to find the second largest number, for this question. THe second solution is an algorithm that takes less time.

# cook your dish here
n = int(input())

li = list(map(int,input().split()))

li.sort(reverse=True)
i = 0
while li[0]==li[i] and i<n-1:
    i=i+1

maximum = li[i]%li[0]


print(maximum)


the other is an algorithm, it is a lot faster (0.02 seconds):

n = input()
a = list(map(int,input().split()))
first_max = 0
second_max = 0
for i in a:
    if i>first_max:
        second_max,first_max=first_max,i
print(second_max)
