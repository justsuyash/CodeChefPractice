Note : This problem can be solved using two loops, but this is more compact solution the space complexity increases with two loops as it uses 2 arrays to store floors.

for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    n,req = map(int,input().split(' '))
    total = 0
    prev = 0
    for i in range(req):
        f,d = map(int,input().split(' '))
        total += abs(f-prev) 
        total += abs(d-f)
        prev = d    
    print(total)
