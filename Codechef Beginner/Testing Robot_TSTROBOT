Note : I was looking to find a solution by just counting L and R: Mabye if we start from a position of 'LR' or 'RL' we maybe able to do so. I will think on it further today


# cook your dish here
for tc in range(int(input())):
    
    n,m = map(int,input().split(' '))
    
    inputs = input()
    count = 0
    li = [0]
    for i in range(len(inputs)):
        if inputs[i] =='R':
            count+=1
            if count not in li:
                li.append(count)
        else:
            count-=1
            if count not in li:
                li.append(count)
    
    print(len(li))
